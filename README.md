# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background

Jack and Beta testers love PlanMyTrip App. They want few changes to take the app to the next level. In this, they recommened specifically, adding the weather discription to the weather data that have already retrieved. Then Adding input statement to filter data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
 

### Purpose

Purpose of this analysis is to complete follwing deliverables:

* Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

* Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

* Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

The Travel App allows customers to search for locations they want to travel based on their temperature preferences.

Once the customers have filtered the database (DataFrame) based on their temperature preferences, a heatmap will be showed to them for the maximum temperature for the filtered cities around the world.
